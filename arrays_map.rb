#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].

# numbers = [3,4,5]
# numeros = []

# numbers.each do |numero|
#   numeros << numero * 3
# end
# p numeros


#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string upcased.
#     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["HELLO", "GOODBYE"].

# words = ["Cranberry", "Raspberry", "Currant"]
# cap_words = []

# words.each do |w|
#   cap_words << w.upcase
# end
# p cap_words

#  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of string values from each hash's :name key.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes ["Alice", "Blane"].

# products = [{ name: "Iphone", model: "12"}, {name: "Xiaomi", model: "M40"}]
# prod_name = []

# products.each do |p|
#   prod_name << p[:name]
# end
# p prod_name

#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number plus 7.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [8, 9, 10]

# numbers = [2,3,4]
# numero = []
# numbers.each do |number|
#   numero << number + 7
# end

# p numero

#  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string's length.
#     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes [5, 7].

# strings = ["three", "five"]
# num_length = []
# strings.each do |s|
#   num_length << s.length
# end
# p num_length

#  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of number values from each hash's :age key.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [27, 16].

# two_people = [{name: "Alejendra", age: 20}, {name: "Alicia", age: 19}]
# ages = []
# two_people.each do |a|
#   ages << a[:age]
# end
# p ages

#  7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number divided by 2.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [0.5, 1.0, 1.5].

  # start = [2,4,80]
  # by_seven = []

  # start.each do |s|
  #   by_seven << s / 2
  # end
  # p by_seven

#  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string's first letter only.
#     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["h", "g"].

wordy = ["one", "two"]
not_wordy = []

# 9.  Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of number values from each hash's :age key times 2.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [54, 32].

# 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number converted into a string.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes ["1", "2", "3"].
